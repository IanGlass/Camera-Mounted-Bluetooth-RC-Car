# Camera Mounted Bluetooth Model Car

Embedded systems six-person project (known as "Wacky Racers") to design and implement a camera mounted, Bluetooth controlled, model car. The project had a requirement that three separate 4-layer boards (1:motor driver, 2:camera driver and 3:main/wifi communications) were developed each with their own microcontroller and communicated over a common I2C bus. STM32F4 microcontrollers were selected for the project.
